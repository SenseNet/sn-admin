Upgrade and package executor tool for Sense/Net ECM. It is used to execute packages on the Content Repository (e.g. upgrade packages published by Sense/Net for *Enterprise* customers, or custom packages assembled by anyone). It also helps developers and operators automate their processes (e.g. a build or deployment workflow).

[SnAdmin](http://wiki.sensenet.com/SnAdmin) can be considered as a framework built on a script language that describes a set of steps to be executed one after the other. Sense/Net ECM offers many [built-in steps](http://wiki.sensenet.com/Built-in_steps) and it is also possible for third party developers to [create custom steps](http://wiki.sensenet.com/How_to_create_a_custom_step_for_SnAdmin) to include in custom packages.
